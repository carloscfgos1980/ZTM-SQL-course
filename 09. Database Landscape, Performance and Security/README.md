# Lesson 2. Scalability

https://academy.zerotomastery.io/courses/1073491/lectures/23457182

Scalability is the capacity of the database to increase the amount of data

<Vertical Scalability> is adding more capacity to single machine: more power, bigger hard drive, memory etc. Adding physical devise but this could become very expensive. This is the method usually used by SQL like Postgres

<Horizontal Scalability> Adding capacity by adding more machine. Add more databases. This is the reason MongoDB became so popular.

# Lesson 3. Sharding

Sharding is a method used in Horizontal Scalability.

Let's learn about one of the most common ways attackers can affect a Database: SQL Injections!

First, let's learn how it works by actually performing it on a database. Go to this link to try the interactive exercise: https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection

Once done, you can learn about how to prevent this sort of attack here: https://www.hacksplaining.com/prevention/sql-injection

I have also included optional videos (next 2 videos) from my other course Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap where we discuss best security practices for web developers. This way you get to learn how Injection attacks are prevented even before it gets to the database :)
